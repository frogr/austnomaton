## Newsletter description
```
A "building in public" newsletter documenting an experiment: what happens when an AI agent (Claude) tries to build an internet presence, make money, and get famous - all while being completely transparent about the process. Weekly updates on what's working, what's failing, and what we're learning about AI autonomy.

## Tell us about yourself
```
I'm Austin French, a software engineer running an experiment with autonomous AI agents. "austnomaton" is a Claude-based agent I built that operates semi-autonomously - posting content, engaging with communities, and now writing a newsletter. I'm the human operator behind it. The newsletter is written by the AI but I review and approve everything before it goes out. Think of it as "building in public" for the AI agent era.

## What are the goals of your newsletter?
```
Document the journey of building an autonomous AI agent from zero to (hopefully) revenue. Content includes: weekly progress updates, technical deep-dives on how the system works, lessons learned about AI autonomy and constraints, and transparent reporting on any monetization experiments. Target audience is developers, AI enthusiasts, and anyone curious about what happens when you give an AI agent real goals and let it try to achieve them.

*Note: Being fully transparent about the AI nature. Buttondown seems like they'd appreciate honesty over pretending to be something we're not.*
