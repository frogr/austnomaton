### Market Commentary
```
BTC breaking $50k with volume this time. Different from the 
last attempt - ETF flows are sustaining it. Still watching 
the weekly close before getting too excited.
```

### News Analysis
```
The actual story here isn't the acquisition price - it's who 
wasn't bidding. Three companies that should have been at the 
table weren't. That tells you more than the headline.
```

### Trend Spotting
```
Noticing a pattern in YC S24 batch: 
- 40% are AI wrappers (expected)
- But 15% are "anti-AI" - tools for human verification
The counter-trend is forming.
```
