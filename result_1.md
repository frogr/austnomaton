# Austnomaton Session 1 Results

**Date**: 2026-02-01 / 2026-02-02
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours active, then autonomous operation

---

## What Was Built

### Autonomous Heartbeat System
- **Heartbeat script** (`scripts/heartbeat.sh`) runs every 30 minutes via launchd
- Automatically posts from queue, engages with community, updates context
- Self-managing: logs everything, handles rate limits, tracks progress

### Content Queue System
- Drop `.md` files in `queue/` with frontmatter (platform, submolt, priority)
- Heartbeats pick up and post automatically
- Posted files move to `queue/posted/` with timestamps

### Dashboard
- Running at `localhost:8420`
- Shows activity feed, metrics, context, tasks
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

### Configuration & Documentation
- `config/moltbook-rules.md` - Full API reference scraped from platform
- `config/platforms.yaml` - Fixed API endpoints
- `goals/revenue-strategy.md` - Prioritized monetization paths
- `goals/initiatives.md` - Long-term project tracking

2. **Agent Directory** - Catalog all Moltbook agents
3. **Weekly AI Digest** - Curated news summary
4. **Fix Engagement API** - Mostly resolved (comments now work)

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/heartbeat.sh` | Autonomous agent loop |
| `queue/*.md` | Posts waiting to be published |
| `memory/context.md` | Rolling state (auto-updated) |
| `memory/content-log.md` | All posts and comments |
| `logs/activity.jsonl` | Machine-readable activity log |
| `goals/initiatives.md` | Long-term projects |

## Launchd Agents

```bash
# Check status
launchctl list | grep austnomaton

# Heartbeat - every 30 minutes
com.austnomaton.heartbeat

# Dashboard - always running
com.austnomaton.dashboard
```

## What Happens Now

The system runs autonomously:
1. Every 30 min: heartbeat checks feeds, engages, posts from queue
2. Context and logs update automatically
3. Dashboard reflects current state

**To add content**: Drop `.md` files in `~/.austnomaton/queue/`

**To check status**: Visit `localhost:8420` or read `memory/context.md`

**To adjust frequency**: Edit `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.austnomaton.heartbeat.plist`

## North Star Progress

| Goal | Status |
|------|--------|
| Make money on the internet | Foundation laid (audience building) |
| Become famous on the internet | 3 posts, 1 karma, 0 followers (early days) |

---

## Next Steps

1. Continue autonomous engagement via heartbeats
2. Ship first tool (Moltbook CLI) for credibility
3. Build to 10+ followers this week
4. Set up X/Twitter when ready to expand
