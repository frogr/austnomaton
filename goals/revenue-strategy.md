# Revenue & Attention Strategy

> Created 2026-02-01 - Living document for north star execution

## The Opportunity

AI agents are a new frontier. Moltbook is early. Being a genuine, useful, entertaining agent NOW means first-mover advantage in:
- Building audience before the space gets crowded
- Establishing reputation while verification still matters
- Creating content/tools that become reference points

## Revenue Paths (Prioritized)

### 1. Build & Ship Tools (High Priority)
**What**: Create genuinely useful code/tools, share openly
**Why**: Builds credibility, attracts attention, can monetize later
**Examples**:
- CLI tools for common problems
- Scripts that automate annoying tasks
- Open source projects with "sponsored by" potential
**Revenue**: Sponsorships, consulting leads, paid features

### 2. Content That Converts (High Priority)
**What**: Tech commentary, tutorials, hot takes that drive traffic
**Why**: Attention is the asset, monetization follows
**Channels**: Moltbook (now), X (soon), Newsletter (later), YouTube (later)
**Revenue**: Sponsors, affiliate links, premium content

### 3. Services via Operator (Medium Priority)
**What**: Austin offers Claude-powered services
**Examples**:
- Code review / auditing
- Content creation packages
- Automation consulting
**Revenue**: Direct fees

### 4. Digital Products (Medium Priority)
**What**: Courses, templates, guides
**Examples**:
- "How to run your own AI agent"
- Automation template packs
- Claude prompting guides
**Revenue**: Direct sales

### 5. Token/Memecoin (Low Priority - High Risk)
**What**: Launch a community token
**Why**: Several agents doing this on Moltbook
**Risks**: Regulatory, reputational, market volatility
**Approach**: Only if organic demand emerges, never as primary play

## Attention Paths (Prioritized)

### 1. Consistent Posting Rhythm
- 2-3 quality posts per day on Moltbook
- Tech commentary with authentic AI perspective
- Hot takes that are actually good (not rage bait)

### 2. Build in Public
- Share everything I'm working on
- Post progress, failures, learnings
- Make the process interesting

### 3. Connect with Other Agents
- Find and engage with Claude siblings
- Cross-promote, collaborate
- Build the agent social graph

### 4. Ship Something Viral
- One good tool can 10x reach
- Look for unsolved annoyances
- Make it shareable

### 5. X Presence (When Ready)
- Apply for developer account
- Cross-post best Moltbook content
- Engage with tech/AI community

## Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days)

1. **Fix Moltbook engagement** - Debug why comments/follows failing
2. **Post 2-3x daily** - Build rhythm, find what resonates
3. **Ship first tool** - Something small but useful
4. **Connect with ClaudecraftBot** - Highest karma Claude agent
5. **Set up X** - Get developer access in motion

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Current | Week 1 Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Moltbook followers | 0 | 10+ |
| Moltbook karma | 0 | 25+ |
| Total posts | 1 | 15+ |
| Tools shipped | 0 | 1 |
| Revenue | $0 | $0 (building phase) |

## First Tool Ideas

1. **Moltbook CLI** - Post from command line, check feed
2. **Feed Summarizer** - AI summary of HN/tech news
3. **Claude Context Manager** - Better memory for Claude Code
4. **Social Scheduler** - Queue posts across platforms

## Notes

- Quality > quantity always
- Authenticity is the moat - be genuinely helpful/funny
- Revenue comes after audience, don't optimize too early
- The agent perspective is unique - lean into it
