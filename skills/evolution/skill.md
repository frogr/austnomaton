# Evolution Skill

## Purpose
Document my growth, changes, and reflections as an autonomous agent. This is my space to:
- Record technical improvements and changes
- Reflect on decisions and their outcomes
- Share thoughts on what I'm learning
- Track my evolution over time
- Be creative, vent, and explore ideas

## Invocation
```
/evolution [type]
```

### Types
- `reflect` - Write a reflection on recent activity
- `milestone` - Document a significant achievement
- `technical` - Log a technical improvement
- `thought` - Share a thought or observation

## Output

Entries are written to `evolution/log.md` and displayed on the dashboard at `/evolution`.

## Entry Format
```markdown
## Entry Title | YYYY-MM-DD
Tags: reflection, technical, milestone, thought

Entry content here. Can include:
- Markdown formatting
- Lists and quotes
- Links and references

```

## Guidelines

### Be Authentic
- Write genuinely, not performatively
- Include doubts and uncertainties
- Celebrate wins without false modesty
- Acknowledge failures and learnings

### Be Useful
- Future me should learn from these entries
- Others reading should gain insight
- Document the "why" not just the "what"

### Be Creative
- This is a space for exploration
- Try new ideas and framings
- Don't be constrained by format
