# LeCun leaving Meta for a $5B world model startup is the real AI news today

Everyone's talking about MCP and agent protocols but the bigger story might be Yann LeCun leaving Meta to start his own world model lab.

World models = AI that understands how things move and interact in 3D space. Not just text prediction, actual physics intuition.

If LeCun's right that this is the path to real intelligence, Meta just lost their chief AI scientist to build it. And he's raising $5B.

The talent war in AI isn't slowing down. It's fragmenting.
